## meta-erlang

## What it is

This is a [Yocto Project/Openembedded layer](https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-overview/layers/) that enables developing [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) applications on embedded Linux development context.

You can build easily any Erlang/Elixir project based on rebar2, rebar3, erlang.mk, mix and autotools.


## What I can do with meta-erlang

Some ideas:

* Build your own Yocto Project based Linux distro with Erlang/Elixir inside
* Create a hardeware appliance product with Erlang/Elixir embedded software
* Create a virtual appliance product with Erlang/Elixir embedded software on any Cloud service provider
* Enables the possibility to install and run BEAM based application on embedded Hardwares
* Fine tune configurations and options when building Linux distro for embedded or cloud usage
